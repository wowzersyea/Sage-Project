Let me compile the information I found, focusing on the articles published within the required timeframe.\n\n# \ud83d\udcda Literature Digest: February 08 - February 22, 2026\n\n## \ud83d\udea8 Practice-Changing / Action Required\nNo significant publications identified this period.\n\n## \ud83d\udccb Guideline Updates\n\n**IDSA Statement on Childhood Vaccine Schedule Changes**\n*IDSA News Release, February 2026* | https://www.idsociety.org/news--publications-new/articles/2026/idsa-statement-on-childhood-vaccine-schedule/\nIDSA strongly opposes HHS changes to the U.S. childhood vaccine schedule without transparent process or scientific justification, warning that \"upending long-standing vaccine recommendations without transparent public review and engagement with external experts will undermine confidence in vaccines\" and will lead to decreased vaccination rates during ongoing outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.\n\n**PIDS Statement on CDC Childhood Vaccine Recommendations**\n*PIDS News Release, January 5, 2026* | https://pids.org/2026/01/05/pids-statement-on-announced-cdc-changes-to-childhood-vaccine-recommendations/\nPIDS opposes announced CDC changes to childhood immunization schedule organization and presentation, stating it will \"cause confusion in pediatric offices for practitioners and parents alike, and result in fewer children protected against severe, preventable diseases\". PIDS endorses the AAP recommended immunization schedule, which \"has been instrumental in dramatically reducing childhood illness, hospitalization, disability, and death from infectious diseases in the United States\".\n\n**IDSA Guidelines for Complicated UTIs (Adult-focused)**\n*Clinical Infectious Diseases, February 2026* | https://www.contagionlive.com/view/idsa-releases-clinical-guidelines-for-treatment-of-complicated-urinary-tract-infections\n**Note:** Adult-focused guidelines with limited pediatric applicability.\n\n## \ud83d\udc8a Stewardship Highlights\n\n**Antibiotic Stewardship in Pediatric Emergency and Primary Care: Oman's Perspective**\n*Journal of Emergency and Disaster Medicine, February 2, 2026* | https://doi.org/10.1007/s44467-025-00006-5\n**PDF:** Open access available\n- **Access:** OPEN ACCESS\n- **Design:** Narrative review examining antibiotic stewardship practices in pediatric emergency and primary care settings\n- **Methods:** Review of relevant publications from 2013-2023, including clinical guidelines from AAP (2021) and WHO AWaRe classification (2023), along with national Omani data. Thematic synthesis guided by identification of recurring themes across sources rather than formal qualitative coding.\n- **Key Findings:** The review examines antibiotic stewardship practices emphasizing gaps and opportunities within Oman's healthcare framework, noting that antimicrobial resistance poses a significant global health challenge with children being particularly vulnerable.\n- **Clinical Implications:** Provides framework for stewardship implementation in pediatric emergency and primary care settings in resource-limited contexts.\n\n**The Angel in the Marble: Antibiotic Duration in the NICU**\n*Antibiotics, February 20, 2026* | https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6382/15/2/228\n**PDF:** https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6382/15/2/228/pdf\n- **Access:** OPEN ACCESS\n- **Design:** Commentary/perspective piece on optimal antimicrobial duration in neonatal intensive care\n- **Methods:** Uses Michelangelo metaphor for antimicrobial stewardship: \"I saw the angel in the marble and carved until it was free\" to illustrate that stewardship goal is not to reduce antibiotic use to zero but to find optimal duration.\n- **Key Findings:** Well-documented adverse outcomes are directly linked to duration of therapy and include short-term (drug toxicity, antimicrobial resistance, dysbiosis), medium-term (increased rates of sepsis, NEC, death) and long-term complications (metabolic syndrome, obesity, autoimmune diseases). Optimal duration must follow \"Goldilocks principle\" - not too little, not too much, but just right.\n- **Discussion:** Emphasizes that NICU stewardship is \"as much an art as it is a science\" requiring clinical experience mixed with targeted research to \"chisel away the prolonged and unnecessary antibiotic use, until only the necessary remains\".\n- **Clinical Implications:** Provides conceptual framework for approaching antibiotic duration decisions in neonatal sepsis, meningitis, and NEC.\n\n## \ud83e\udda0 Pediatric ID Studies\n\n**US Emergency Department Visits for Antibiotic Adverse Drug Events in Children, 2019-2023**\n*Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, February 2026* | https://doi.org/10.1093/jpids/piag001\n**PDF:** Paywalled\n- **Access:** PAYWALLED\n- **Design:** Retrospective analysis of national emergency department surveillance data, 2019-2023\n- **Key Findings:** Antibiotics were implicated in over one-third of pediatric adverse drug event visits during 2019-2023, representing an estimated average of 47,628 ED visits annually and 73,095 in 2023, confirming that \"antibiotics remain a high yield target for pediatric ADE prevention\".\n- **Clinical Implications:** Supports continued focus on outpatient antimicrobial stewardship to reduce preventable adverse events.\n[PAYWALL: Abstract only reviewed]\n\n**Cost-effectiveness of Text Message System for COVID-19 Testing in K-12 Schools**\n*Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, February 2026* | https://academic.oup.com/jpids/article-pdf/15/1/piaf111/66533999/piaf111.pdf\n**PDF:** https://academic.oup.com/jpids/article-pdf/15/1/piaf111/66533999/piaf111.pdf\n- **Access:** OPEN ACCESS\n- **Design:** Cost-effectiveness analysis using school district perspective with 9-month academic year time horizon, analyzing intensive text messaging (ITM) and intensive text messaging plus health navigation (ITM+HN) versus usual care\n- **Methods:** Simulation model with multiple sensitivity and scenario analyses to test robustness of assumptions, though authors acknowledge use of static rather than dynamic modeling\n- **Key Findings:** Usual care was least expensive ($94,087 overall, $11 per family) followed by ITM ($239,719 overall, $29 per family) and ITM+HN ($284,604 overall, $34 per family), with ITM+HN resulting in the most COVID-19 tests taken (9,072)\n- **Discussion:** Authors suggest schools may wish to build capacity for trained community health workers or existing staff to provide health navigation services during disruptive events, which could \"allow schools to implement testing or other essential health services that could reduce missed school or work days\"\n- **Limitations:** Analysis had several limitations including simplifying assumptions inherent to simulation models, though sensitivity analyses were performed to address assumption dependency\n- **Clinical Implications:** Provides economic framework for implementing COVID-19 testing programs in school settings.\n\n**Management of Serious Staphylococcus aureus Infections in Children: Canadian Survey**\n*Paediatrics & Child Health, February 8, 2026* | https://doi.org/10.1093/pch/pxaf122\n**PDF:** https://academic.oup.com/pch/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/pch/pxaf122/66634273/pxaf122.pdf\n- **Access:** OPEN ACCESS\n- **Design:** Survey of Canadian pediatric infectious diseases physicians regarding management practices for serious S. aureus infections\n- **Key Findings:** For MSSA infections outside CNS, 56.4% (n=22) preferred cefazolin while 26.3% (n=10) used ceftriaxone/cefotaxime. Prescribing penicillin for penicillin-sensitive SA was divided with 51.3% (n=20) choosing to use it. Most respondents chose 14-day treatment for SA bacteremia without focus in immunocompetent children (89.7%, n=35) and neonates (92.3%, n=36). Variability observed in ordering abdominal ultrasounds and echocardiograms for SAB without focus, and in transition to oral antibiotics for MSSA bacteremia.\n- **Discussion:** Majority indicated they would never transition to oral antibiotics for either MSSA (76.9%, n=30) or MRSA (74.4%, n=29) bacteremia. Tendency to transition to oral antibiotics in children was positively correlated with same practice in neonates.\n- **Limitations:** Survey-based methodology limits generalizability and clinical outcome assessment.\n- **Clinical Implications:** Reveals significant practice variation in S. aureus management, suggesting need for standardized guidelines.\n\n## \ud83d\udcf0 Notable General ID\n\n**Temporal Clustering of Mycoplasma pneumoniae-Associated Encephalitis and Stroke in South Korea**\n*Emerging Infectious Diseases, February 2026* | https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/32/2/pdfs/25-1296.pdf\n**PDF:** https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/32/2/pdfs/25-1296.pdf\n- **Access:** OPEN ACCESS\n- **Design:** Retrospective analysis of 17 pediatric encephalitis (n=12) or stroke (n=5) cases that clustered temporally during the 2023-2024 M. pneumoniae epidemic in South Korea, noting similar patterns had not been observed in previous seasons\n- **Methods:** Assessed nationwide trends in M. pneumoniae-associated admissions, encephalitis, and pediatric stroke from public datasets, obtaining M. pneumoniae-associated hospitalization data from Korean sources\n- **Key Findings:** During June-December, M. pneumoniae infections accounted for substantially longer hospital stays (29 vs. 6 days; p<0.001) and higher intensive care unit admission rates. This pattern might be partially explained by the immunity gap hypothesis, whereby prolonged suppression of M. pneumoniae neurologic complications during pandemic restrictions led to increased susceptibility.\n- **Discussion:** Findings might reflect post-pandemic changes in clinical manifestation and underscore the need for neurologic surveillance during M. pneumoniae outbreaks\n- **Clinical Implications:** Heightened awareness needed for neurologic complications during M. pneumoniae outbreaks.\n\n**Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever in Mexican Children: 20-Year Analysis**\n*Emerging Infectious Diseases, February 2026* | https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/\n- **Access:** OPEN ACCESS\n- **Design:** Retrospective investigation of 500 pediatric RMSF patients hospitalized in Sonora during 2004-2024, analyzing clinical, laboratory, and sociodemographic data using descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression\n- **Key Findings:** Overall case-fatality rate was 19.8%, decreasing from 31.4% (2004-2013) to 14.5% (2014-2024). Fatal outcomes associated with delayed doxycycline treatment (>5 days after symptom onset), older age, Indigenous background, and abnormal laboratory markers. Among survivors, 16% had life-altering sequelae including amputations and neurologic deficits. Cases occurred year-round, predominantly in urban settings, with timely doxycycline administration remaining critical for reducing mortality.\n- **Clinical Implications:** Emphasizes importance of early doxycycline therapy in pediatric RMSF.\n\n**Severe Group A Streptococcus Infections in French Children**\n*Emerging Infectious Diseases, February 2026* | https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/\n- **Access:** OPEN ACCESS  \n- **Design:** Retrospective and prospective study across 34 French hospitals during September 1, 2022-April 1, 2024, enrolling 402 pediatric patients (median age 4 years [IQR 2-7.5]; 42% girls, 58% boys)\n- **Key Findings:** Cases characterized by low proportion of severe skin/soft tissue infections (16%), predominance of severe upper/lower respiratory tract infections (55%), and 3.5% case-fatality rate. In multivariate analysis, hydrocortisone, corticosteroid, and vasopressor therapies significantly associated with major sequelae or death. Molecular analysis revealed emm1 (73.0%) and emm12 (10.8%) strains; M1UK clone represented 50% of emm1 strains.\n- **Clinical Implications:** Emphasizes need for collaboration between \"clinicians, researchers, and public health authorities to mitigate the effects of GAS on child health\".\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f Safety & Drug Updates\nNo significant publications identified this period.\n\n---\n*Bi-weekly digest generated February 22, 2026.
